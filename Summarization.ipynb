I never take it off. In the shower it gets wet & dries in a short time no shrinkage at all. Originally the the delivery was missing a bracelet. I had ordered 2 & one to be gift wrapped. That one was in the pkg. I chatted w/a Customer Service person at Amazon & they sent a new bracelet to me immediately. I received it the next day..no extra charge for overnight shipping. I am very satisfied w/both the bracelet & the Customer Service dept. at Amazon. \n sentiment | positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n-RECORD 9-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n ASIN      | B008RF8XFY                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n rating    | 5.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n review    | Hsu : Since i have purchased this bracelet I have never taken it off.
